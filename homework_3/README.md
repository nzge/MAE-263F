Homework 3: Robotic Control of an Elastic Beam

The beam simulation can be run using the jupyter notebook or the python file by hitting run.

The code runs a time based simulation/solver for a 2d beam that computes control inputs at the beam end provided a beam center trajectory. The control angle and position of the beam end node is tracked.
